Student at Ferris State University. Studying Optometry, but it was not initially my first career path. I was undecided entering college. All I knew was my parents wanted me to continue my schooling. I started pursuing 'Cyber Security' through Ferris State University. A few years into the program I realized I wasn't as passionate as my professors about the subject. I was discouraged and knew the path wasn't meant for me. One day, I was getting my routine eye appointment when it dawned on me. A light bulb flashed as I came to knowledge on the career I truly wanted to pursue. I became obsessed with the eyes and switched my major over to Optometry. I plan to finish my undergrad Fall of 2020 and push onwards at the graduate level. I am hard-working, driven, and extremely energetic. These characteristics have kept me on track these past few years and will continue to drive me to where I want to land. Outside of school, I enjoy disc golf, running, and building computers. My summers consist of those activities and working at my family's auto repair facility.
